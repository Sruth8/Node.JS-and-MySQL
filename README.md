# Node.JS-and-MySQL
HW12

This app was created like an Amazon-like wish list. Using MySql, a database was created with items on a list. This app will take in orders and deplete the items in stock from the "store" inventory. 

To get started
1. Run npm install
2. using the terminal cd into node.app folder,
3. run node bamazonCustomer.js. 
4. Select an item from the list using it's ID.
5. Then tell it how many you want. 
6. If you want to stop this app, all you do is press "s" for stop and it will exit out the app.

Here is a Gif of how this app works.
